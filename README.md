# KEV-ThreatIntel-API
---
<h4>Harness the power of cyber threat intelligence with ease.</h4>
<p>Built on Ruby, this API offers seamless access to data sourced from cisa.gov. CISA, or the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, is the nation's risk advisor, working to defend against today's threats <p></p>and collaborating to build a more secure and resilient infrastructure.</p>
<br>
I aimed to create an API that can provide easy integration for any web application, offering comprehensive information on Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEVs) to bolster your cybersecurity defenses.
